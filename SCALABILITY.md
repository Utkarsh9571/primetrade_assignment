# ðŸ“ˆ Scalability Notes

This project is designed with modularity and scalability in mind:

- âœ… **Modular folder structure** for backend controllers, routes, and middleware
- âœ… **Role-based access control** for future permission layers
- âœ… **Dockerized deployment** for reproducible environments
- âœ… **Swagger documentation** for onboarding and API clarity
- âœ… **MongoDB** can be scaled via Atlas or replica sets
- ðŸ§± Future enhancements:
  - Microservices for auth and notes
  - Redis caching for frequent queries
  - Load balancing with Nginx or HAProxy
  - Logging via Winston or centralized ELK stack
